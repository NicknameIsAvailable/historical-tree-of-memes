For convenient interaction with the tree, I recommend using the application Obsidian.md and use all the settings and plugins downloaded from the repository.

## Making notes with memes

The title of the note should contain the text from the contained mom, or a brief description of the meme, if there is no text in the picture. There should be nothing in the note except the name itself and tags for links.    

## Tag order

1) Language in short format ( #ru, #eng) 
2) Big common theme ( #games, #anime)
3) A specific title, if there is one ( #jjba #fortnite) 
4) Other tags
I also recommend specifying the type of meme if you know it ( #post-irony #demotivator)    
### That's it. Use a tree.
